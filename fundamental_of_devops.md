## DevOps Zero to Hero: Day 1 - Structured Notes

**Introduction:**

* The primary objectives are to:
    * Define DevOps.
    * Explain the rationale behind DevOps.
    * Provide guidance on introducing oneself as a DevOps engineer.
    * Outline typical day-to-day activities of a DevOps engineer.
* Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for DevOps job interviews.

**Subtopics:**

1.  **What is DevOps?**
    * DevOps is a cultural practice aimed at improving an organization's ability to deliver applications.
    * It emphasizes:
        * **Delivery Speed:** Reducing the time it takes to release new application versions or updates.
            * Example: Reducing application delivery from 10 days to hours or minutes.
        * **Automation:** Automating processes to minimize manual intervention.
        * **Quality:** Ensuring application quality through rigorous testing and monitoring.
        * **Monitoring (Observability):** Continuously tracking application performance and identifying potential issues.
            * Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system from its external outputs.
        * **Testing:** Integrating testing throughout the development lifecycle.
    * DevOps is not solely about Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), but encompasses a broader set of practices.
    * A concise definition of DevOps is: "DevOps is a process of improving application delivery by ensuring proper automation, quality, continuous monitoring (observability), and continuous testing."

2.  **Why DevOps?**
    * DevOps addresses the inefficiencies of traditional software development practices.
    * Historically, application delivery involved multiple teams (system administrators, build and release engineers, server administrators), leading to:
        * Manual processes.
        * Communication bottlenecks.
        * Slow delivery times.
        * Example: Deployment process taking 10 days or longer.
    * DevOps consolidates these roles and automates processes, resulting in:
        * Faster delivery.
        * Improved collaboration.
        * Increased efficiency.
    * System Administrator: Responsible for creating and maintaining servers.
    * Build and release engineer: Responsible for deploying the application to servers and promoting it between environments.
    * Server administrator: Responsible for installing and maintaining application servers.
    * Bare metal: Refers to physical servers, as opposed to virtual servers.
    * SVN/CBS: Version control systems used to store and manage code.
    * Pre-prod/staging environment: an environment that mirrors the production environment, used for final testing before release.

3.  **How to Introduce Yourself as a DevOps Engineer:**
    * Clearly state your current DevOps experience.
    * Mention your relevant previous experience (e.g., system administrator, developer).
    * Highlight your roles and responsibilities, emphasizing the four pillars of DevOps (automation, quality, monitoring, testing).
    * If asked, briefly mention relevant tools and technologies (e.g., GitHub Actions, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform).
    * Avoid exaggerating experience.
    * Emphasize the contributions you bring to the organization.

**Conclusion:**

* Understanding the core concepts of DevOps is essential for both practical application and interview success.
* Continued learning and exploration of DevOps practices are encouraged.
* The next session will cover the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and the role of DevOps within it, and will also recap the current days lesson.
