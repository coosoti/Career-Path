## DevOps Zero to Hero: Day 3 - Structured Notes

**Introduction:**

* This session introduces the concept of Virtual Machines (VMs) and their importance in DevOps.
* The session aims to:
    * Explain the difference between physical servers and virtual machines.
    * Define hypervisors and their function.
    * Illustrate how cloud providers utilize VMs.
    * Emphasize the efficiency gains achieved through virtualization.

**Subtopics:**

1.  **Physical Servers vs. Virtual Machines:**
    * **Physical Servers:**
        * Tangible hardware devices that host applications.
        * Resources (CPU, RAM, storage) are dedicated to a single operating system.
        * Example: A physical server purchased from HP or IBM.
    * **Virtual Machines (VMs):**
        * Software-based simulations of physical computers.
        * Multiple VMs can run on a single physical server.
        * Each VM has its own operating system, CPU, RAM, and storage, logically isolated from others.
        * They are a logical partition of a physical server.
        * VMs enable efficient resource utilization.

2.  **Hypervisors:**
    * Software that creates and manages virtual machines.
    * Acts as an intermediary between the physical hardware and the VMs.
    * Enables the logical isolation of VMs on a single physical server.
    * Popular hypervisors include VMware and Xen.
    * The hypervisor is what allows the physical server to be broken up into logical virtual machines.

3.  **Virtualization in Cloud Computing:**
    * Cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) use virtualization to offer on-demand computing resources.
    * They maintain large data centers with numerous physical servers.
    * Hypervisors are installed on these physical servers.
    * When a user requests a VM, the hypervisor allocates resources from a physical server to create the VM.
    * Users access VMs remotely via IP addresses and key pairs.
    * Regions and data centers are built to reduce latency. Latency is the delay between a user request and a server response.
    * Example: An AWS data center in Mumbai hosts physical servers with hypervisors, enabling users in India to access VMs with low latency.
    * EC2 instance is the name amazon gives to its virtual machines.

4.  **Efficiency Gains with Virtualization:**
    * Virtualization maximizes resource utilization by allowing multiple VMs to run on a single physical server.
    * Reduces hardware costs and energy consumption.
    * Enables scalability and flexibility in application deployment.
    * Cloud providers leverage virtualization to serve millions of users efficiently.
    * It allows for logical isolation, so that different applications and users do not interfere with each other.
    * Example: Instead of having one application per physical server, multiple applications can run on VMs within a single physical server.

**Conclusion:**

* Virtual machines are a fundamental technology in modern IT and DevOps.
* Hypervisors play a crucial role in enabling virtualization.
* Cloud providers utilize VMs to deliver scalable and cost-effective computing resources.
* Virtualization significantly improves resource utilization and efficiency.
* The use of virtual machines has revolutionized the way that applications are deployed and managed.
