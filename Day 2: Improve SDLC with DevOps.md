## DevOps Zero to Hero: Day 2 - Structured Notes

**Introduction:**

* This session focuses on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and its relevance to DevOps.
* The SDLC is a fundamental concept for all IT professionals, regardless of their specific role.
* The session aims to:
    * Explain the SDLC process.
    * Illustrate how DevOps integrates with the SDLC.
    * Clarify the DevOps engineer's role within the SDLC.

**Subtopics:**

1.  **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Overview:**
    * The SDLC is a standardized process used in the software industry to design, develop, and test software.
    * It ensures the delivery of high-quality products that meet customer expectations.
    * The core phases of the SDLC include:
        * Planning
        * Design
        * Building (Development)
        * Testing
        * Deployment
    * The SDLC is often represented as a circular process, indicating its iterative nature for ongoing feature development and updates.

2.  **SDLC Phases Explained:**
    * **Planning:**
        * Involves gathering requirements from customers and stakeholders.
        * Determines the feasibility and scope of the project.
        * Product owners and business analysts play key roles.
        * Example: Conducting customer surveys to determine interest in a new product feature.
    * **Design:**
        * Consists of high-level design (HLD) and low-level design (LLD).
        * **HLD:** Defines the overall system architecture, scalability, and availability.
            * Example: Choosing a database system and defining its replication strategy.
        * **LLD:** Details the specific components, modules, and functions of the software.
            * Example: Specifying function calls, arguments, and expected responses.
        * Architects and senior developers are responsible for the design phase.
        * Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documents are created to detail the requirements.
    * **Building (Development):**
        * Developers write the application code based on the design specifications.
        * Code is stored in a source code repository (e.g., Git).
        * Peer code reviews are conducted to ensure code quality.
    * **Testing:**
        * Quality assurance (QA) engineers test the application to identify bugs and ensure quality.
        * The application is deployed to a testing server for evaluation.
    * **Deployment:**
        * The tested application is deployed to the production environment, where it is accessible to customers.
        * This phase transitions the software from a test environment to a live environment.

3.  **DevOps Integration with the SDLC:**
    * DevOps engineers focus on automating the building, testing, and deployment phases.
    * Automation improves efficiency and reduces manual intervention.
    * DevOps practices aim to accelerate the delivery process while maintaining quality.
    * The devops engineer is not responsible for the development, testing, or deployment of the software itself, but instead for the automation of those processes.
    * DevOps engineers are critical in implementing CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipelines.
    * While DevOps engineers primarily focus on the building, testing, and deployment phases, their expertise can be valuable in other SDLC phases as well.

4.  **Project Management Methodologies:**
    * Various project management methodologies exist, including:
        * Waterfall model.
        * Iterative model.
        * Agile model.
    * Agile methodology is widely adopted in modern software development.
    * Agile involves iterative development cycles (Sprints) and continuous feedback.
    * The agile methodology allows for a more flexible and responsive development process.

**Conclusion:**

* Understanding the SDLC is crucial for all IT professionals, especially DevOps engineers.
* DevOps plays a vital role in automating and optimizing the SDLC, particularly in the building, testing, and deployment phases.
* The adoption of agile methodologies enhances the efficiency and adaptability of the SDLC.
* DevOps engineers contribute to the organization's efficiency by automating processes and reducing manual intervention.
* The SDLC is a standard process that is followed regardless of if the deployment is on cloud, or on premises.
