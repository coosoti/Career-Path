##3. How to Create Virtual Machines (On the Cloud)

Let's explore the efficient creation of virtual machines (VMs). Initially, we grasp the concept of VMs as independent, virtualized computers operating within a physical server. The focus now shifts to streamlining their creation.

Imagine a scenario where a single VM is needed. Accessing a cloud provider's (AWS or Azure) web interface and manually configuring the VM is feasible. However, what if numerous VMs are required daily? This manual approach proves inefficient and error-prone. This underscores the necessity for automation.

Cloud providers offer Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which act as digital communication channels. These APIs enable programmatic VM creation through scripting, bypassing manual configuration.

* **API Usage Requirements:**
    * Scripts must adhere to API specifications (valid).
    * User authentication is required (authenticated).
    * Appropriate permissions must be granted (authorized).

Various tools and techniques facilitate VM creation automation:

* **AWS Command Line Interface (CLI):** Enables command-driven interaction with AWS services.
* **AWS API (Boto3):** Facilitates direct API interaction through programming languages.
* **AWS CloudFormation Templates (CFT):** Allows infrastructure definition through templates.
* **AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK):** Enables infrastructure definition through programming code.
* **Terraform:** A platform-agnostic tool for multi-cloud infrastructure automation.

Tool selection depends on specific requirements:

* For AWS-centric environments, AWS-specific tools such as CDK are advantageous.
* For multi-cloud or hybrid cloud deployments, Terraform is optimal.

A demonstration showcases manual VM creation via the AWS console, and the process is similar within the Azure portal.

* **Free Tier Availability:** Both AWS and Azure offer free tiers for experimentation.
* AWS free tier has a longer duration than the Azure free tier.

Future demonstrations will focus on automated VM creation using APIs and scripting.

In essence, the transition from manual to automated VM creation is emphasized, highlighting efficiency as a core DevOps principle. Various automation tools and techniques are presented, and the importance of selecting the appropriate tool based on organizational needs is stressed. A practical demonstration of manual VM creation is provided, and the stage is set for future exploration of automated VM provisioning.
